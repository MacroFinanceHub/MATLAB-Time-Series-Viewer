# MATLAB-Time-Series-Viewer
A vintage simple time series viewer for MATLAB.

The time series viewer is a tool for interactive exploration of time series data. It was designed with flight test data in mind, but could be used for other applications.
This viewer allows you to interactively visualize time series data in your MATLAB workspace. It provides limited analysis capabilities, too. For the purposes of this application, "time series data" refers to parameters that vary only as a function of time. Specifically, this application is restricted to working with vectors (i.e. 1xN or Nx1).
